## What Macbook do you have? [ARCHIVED - 2023-01-01]

I am still using the 2015 Macbook Pro (yes still in 2022). This 7 year old laptop still runs great for all of my needs (development, music production, video editing and image editing).

These are the specs at a glance:
* Intel "Core i7" Quad Core 2.5 GHz
* 16GB RAM
* 500GB SSD
* AMD Radeon R9 M370X 2GB GPU

This is the second 2015 Macbook pro I have owned. The first one I got brand new in 2015. I decided to replace it with a similar model but with a faster processor, more hard drive space and a dedicated GPU. The current one I bought lightly used on ebay in May 2020.

## What are those LEDs on screen?

I used to have 8 LEDs displayed on screen that were controlled by twitch chat. I built it live on stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkzhfXJlp0

You could make the LEDs on the screen change state using "!led (8-digit binary number)". 1 is on, 0 is off.
