# Most Asked

## What theme do you use in VSCode?

Right now, [Just Black](https://vscodethemes.com/e/nur.just-black) (with a few modifications).

You can get a link to my current theme (including the settings to modify it), as well as theme's I've used in the past in my settings repo:

https://github.com/CodingGarden/vscode-settings

## What font do you use in VSCode?

Anonymous Pro:

https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro

## How do you select emojis in VSCode?

This is not a VSCode plugin. This is just built in to a Mac and works anywhere:

* Mac: CMD + CTRL + Space

This also works on Windows 10:

* Windows: Windows Key + Space

## What is that break reminder that keeps popping up?

It's called [Time Out by Dejal](https://www.dejal.com/timeout/). It is Mac only software.

I have it setup to show:
  * 10 second micro break every 15 minutes
  * 5 minute long break every 60 minutes

There is also a cross platform break timer call [Stretchly](https://hovancik.net/stretchly/). I have not used it but a lot of people have recommended it.

## What keyboard do you use?

It is an inexpensive 60% mechanical keyboard from a company called E-Element. I got the black version with brown switches. I don't know much about mechanical keyboards, and I got this one just to try it out. It works well enough for me.

* Direct link (protect your privacy) - https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M3UQX1Y/

Also checkout https://coding.garden/gear for more info on my setup.

## What extension do you use to search with !npm and !mdn

This is not an extension. I have [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) set as my default search engine, and these are called [bang commands](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).

Some of the ones I use most often:
* !npm - npm
* !mdn - Mozilla Developer Network
* !gh - Github
* !w - Wikipedia
* !g - google

# Twitch / Stream

## What is your schedule?

View my schedule here: https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden/schedule

Also, join the discord for updates, unplanned streams and go live notifications: https://coding.garden/discord

## Do you do this fulltime?

No. Just part time. See the [personal questions section](#what-do-you-do-for-a-living) for more info.

## What are the rules of the chat?

All chat messages should abide by the Coding Garden code of conduct: https://cdg.sh/conduct

In summary:

0. Be kind.
1. Be mindful of your language.
2. Be respectful.
3. Be considerate.
4. Be open minded.

## Why is the chat in slow mode?

I used to be able to respond to every single message in the chat, but this is just not possible anymore. Slow mode gives me a fighting chance 😅.

The mods (and I) adjust slow mode based on how many people are watching and how busy the chat is.

Whatever the slow mode is set to, use that time to construct a beautiful and thoughtful message instead of just spamming.

## How is your chair (and hair) green?

[I use a blue screen](https://coding.garden/gear/). In the early days, I used a green screen, but with the garden theme, things are often green, so I switched to a blue screen.

## What are those LEDS on screen?

They are controlled by twitch chat. I built it live on stream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onkzhfXJlp0

You can make the LEDs on the screen change state using "!led (8-digit binary number)". 1 is on, 0 is off.

## What are channel points / seedlings?

You can earn channel points (seedlings) by watching the stream. Learn more about how much you will earn [here](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/channel-points-guide#viewers).

Seedlings can be used to redeem rewards like stretch, hydrate, focus mode, code reviews and more.

Click the icon below the twitch chat to redeem them.

## How did you make those overlays / chat window?

All of my overlays were created live on stream! (Links to videos coming soon...)

All of the code for my overlays is open source under the MIT license. Links to the repos can be found here: https://git.io/stream-code

# History of Coding Garden

## How long have you been doing this?

My first live stream was broadcasted to [YouTube on February 19th, 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aql62xliRzE). My YouTube channel had about 300 subscribers at the time, and there were a max of 3 people in the chat.

Between February 2018 and October 2019, I did **158** live streams on YouTube only.

On October 2nd, 2019, I did my [first live stream on Twitch + YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1wRSB_MpzE). I was using some open source software called [docker-multistreamer](https://github.com/jprjr/docker-multistreamer) to do this. At the time I was not a twitch affiliate, so I was able to cross-stream without violating any terms.

This began my slow transition from YouTube to Twitch.

Between October 2019 and April 2020, I did **100** live streams on YouTube + Twitch.

On April 27th 2020, I signed the Twitch affiliate agreement and started streaming only on Twitch.

Between April 2020 and July 2020, I did **52** live streams on Twitch only.

On July 20th 2020, I got accepted into the Twitch Partner program.

In total between February 2018 and July 2020, I have done **311** live streams.

## How did you start live streaming?

I'm an educator at heart. My live streams started as a way for me to continue teaching outside of the classroom.

I taught Full Stack Web Development at a code school for 3+ years. I taught 150+ students and 6+ cohorts. During this time, I honed my teaching and presentation skills. 

My students were often at many different stages of learning, so my teaching style reflected that. Instead of pre-planning all of my lessons, my lessons were planned the day of, based on where my students were and based on what they needed to learn next. This was the beginnings of my improvisational style. My lessons were often live code-alongs, and I often would need to quickly code an example from scratch to demonstrate a concept.

My [early YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM_i0obccy3uwR6ZYa7QE03xDRAqs4Aso) were actually meant for my students. I was teaching a class of 30 students with 1 assistant, and we needed a way to efficiently provide help to all of the students in a timely manner. My YouTube videos were a way for me to "clone" myself. If a student was having trouble with a topic, I could point them to a video.

I took a 3 month break from that job in early 2018, and my live streams were a way for me to continue teaching outside of the classroom. I returned to that job in mid 2018, but I continued to live stream in my spare time, and continued to grow my channel.

> In terms of getting started with live streaming hardware / tech / logistics: I used to play and record music, so I already had microphones / audio recording equipment on hand. Also, before I began live streaming myself, I had started to live stream my students' project presentations, so I already had an HDMI capture card on hand. I'm also just generally knowledgeable / handy when it comes to computers / tech, so setting up live stream equipment was second nature for me.

## Where did the name Coding Garden come from?

The same way I name most of my projects 😀. I [searched for a domain](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=coding)!

The [coding.garden](https://coding.garden) domain was available, so I went with that. The garden theme is nice because it plays right into the idea of growing as a software developer.

# Personal

## Are you self taught? Do you have a computer science degree?

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. My university did not offer any CS specializations at the time, but I did take a few courses in Cybersecurity / Computer Forensics.

I have a highly technical education / background, but I've been self learning all my life. I started teaching myself basic programming and building websites when I was in middle school.

## How long have you been coding?

Over 15 years! I started coding HTML / CSS websites as a kid. Learned Java, C, C++ in college. Wrote C# / .NET desktop applications for a while. Started learning modern web technologies in my spare time, taught JavaScript full stack web development for 3+ years, and now I work as a Chief Full Stack Engineer.

## What do you do for a living?

I work full time as the Chief Full Stack Engineer at a Software Consultancy in Denver, Colorado.

## What does CJ R. stand for?

Whatever you want it to stand for.

_Everyone_ has always called me **CJ**. Just call me **CJ**.

Please don't ask about my first / last name, or share my first / last name in the chat if you do know it.

## How old are you?

You don't want to know. You will either be disappointed, surprised, or it will have no effect. Either way, you really don't want to know.

I usually say I'm 75+ on stream as a joke. I'm a bit younger than that. Please don't ask about my age, or share my age in the chat if you do know it.

## Who is that dog on the getting started screen? Do you really have a Saint Bernard?

I do have a dog! His name is Panzer. He is a ~4 year old Saint Bernard. He weighs about 120+ lbs. He is a very good boy, but he is afraid of the stairs, so he will not come down stairs to where I stream.

I was streaming at an undisclosed location once, and [he did make an appearance](https://clips.twitch.tv/FantasticFreezingCrabBudStar).

One day I'll setup my stream upstairs and have a dog cam 🐶.

# Tech Preferences

## Why don't you use VIM?

TBD

## Why do you prefer Vue.js?

TBD

## Where are those gss and gaa git shortcuts defined?

You can see my `.bash_profile` including all of my aliases [here](https://github.com/w3cj/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile#L47).

## What is your preferred deployment method?

TBD

# Setup / Computer

## Why do you use a Mac?

TBD

## What browser do you use? What extensions do you use?

TBD

## Why do you use DuckDuckGo?

They respect my [privacy](https://spreadprivacy.com/why-use-duckduckgo-instead-of-google/).

They have a great way to search across other websites with [bang commands](https://duckduckgo.com/bang).

## How is your YouTube green themed?

I use an extension called [Enhancer for Youtube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhancer-for-youtube/)

# Miscellaneous

## What chair do you use?

I use an Ikea Markus chair. They don't sell the green one anymore, but you can still get a black / grey one [here](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/markus-office-chair-vissle-dark-gray-90289172/).

## Why is your CPU 170 degrees celsius?

It's not. The measurement displayed is in degrees fahrenheit.

## I'm banned in twitch chat! I did nothing wrong! What do I do?

This seems to be an issue a lot of people have at random.

* Try refreshing the page.
* Log out / Log in.
* Try a different browser.
* Try using a different device.
* Try disabling extensions.
* Try a different operating system.
* Try using the twitch app instead of the browser.
* Try using a twitch chat client like Chatty or Chatterino.
* Write your own twitch client with tmi.js...
* Try all the things.

Sorry this is happening. If none of these things work, contact twitch support: https://help.twitch.tv/s/contactsupport
